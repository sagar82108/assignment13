    "\"\"\"ans2) MongoDB, as a document-oriented NoSQL database, offers several key features that contribute to its popularity and versatility. \n",
    "         Here are some of the notable features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Model: MongoDB stores data in flexible, self-describing documents called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "                Documents are similar to JSON objects and can have varying structures and data types within the same collection. \n",
    "                This schema-less approach allows for easy handling of evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. \n",
    "                                   It supports automatic sharding, which divides data and distributes it across shards for improved performance and scalability.\n",
    "                                   MongoDB also provides built-in replication for high availability, allowing for failover and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying and Indexing: MongoDB offers a powerful and expressive query language for retrieving data.\n",
    "                       It supports a wide range of querying operations, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation. \n",
    "                      Indexes can be created on fields to optimize query performance. MongoDB also provides a rich set of operators and functions for complex data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: The document-based data model of MongoDB allows for dynamic and nested data structures.\n",
    "                    Documents can contain arrays, sub-documents, and other complex data types. \n",
    "                    This flexibility makes MongoDB suitable for handling complex, hierarchical, or evolving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication and Data Consistency: MongoDB supports replica sets, which are self-healing clusters that provide data redundancy and automatic failover. \n",
    "                                  Replica sets ensure high availability and durability of data. MongoDB also offers configurable levels of data consistency,\n",
    "                                 allowing developers to choose the appropriate trade-off between consistency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows for advanced data processing and analytics.\n",
    "                       It supports various operations like grouping, sorting, filtering, and transformation of data within the database.\n",
    "                      The aggregation framework can efficiently process large volumes of data and perform complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial and Full-Text Search: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and provides geospatial indexing and querying capabilities. \n",
    "                                 It enables applications to store and query location-based data effectively. \n",
    "                                 MongoDB also offers full-text search functionality for text-based searching and indexing of textual content.\n",

    "Easy Integration and Development: MongoDB provides official drivers and libraries for various programming languages,\n",
    "                                  making it easy to integrate with different application stacks. It offers a flexible query API and provides rich data manipulation features,\n",
